# ADAPT Drought Forecasting Streamlit App

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **GPU-only application:** this app will not run on CPU. Start it from a shell that already has access to a CUDA GPU.
>
> The app follows the original GPU launch pattern: it uses `DROUGHTAPP_GPU_DEVICE` when set, otherwise it keeps the first value in `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, otherwise it defaults to GPU `0`.
>
> To choose a GPU explicitly:
>
> ```bash
> export DROUGHTAPP_GPU_DEVICE=0
> ```
>
> Replace `0` with the GPU ID assigned to your job or server session. If TensorFlow cannot detect that selected GPU, inference exits instead of falling back to CPU.

This repository contains a Streamlit app for running drought forecasts with bundled model artifacts and normalizations on a precomputed model grid.

The app downloads recent NLDAS forcings at runtime through NASA Earthdata using `earthaccess`. Each user must authenticate with their own NASA Earthdata account.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- A CUDA-capable system GPU with a TensorFlow-compatible CUDA/cuDNN runtime
- Git LFS, needed to download the files in `model_artifacts/`
- A free NASA Earthdata account: <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new>

## Clone

Install Git LFS before cloning or immediately after:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
git lfs pull
```

Check that model files were downloaded correctly:

```bash
git lfs ls-files
find model_artifacts -type f
```

## Python Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Earthdata Login

Run this once on your own machine:

```bash
python -c "import earthaccess; earthaccess.login(persist=True)"
```

This stores your Earthdata credentials locally. The repository does not include or use the project author's credentials.

## Run

First, start or enter a GPU session. On a Slurm cluster, that usually means launching an interactive job similar to:

```bash
salloc --gres=gpu:1 --cpus-per-task=4 --mem=24G --time=02:00:00
```

Use the partition/account flags required by your cluster if needed. After the GPU session starts, confirm TensorFlow can see the GPU:

```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
```

That command must print at least one GPU. Then launch the app. If your scheduler already set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, you can keep it and run:

```bash
./run.sh
```

To choose a GPU explicitly, set:

```bash
export DROUGHTAPP_GPU_DEVICE=0
```

Then launch either way:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

or:

```bash
./run.sh
```

The first forecast run will download NLDAS forcing files into a local cache. Later runs reuse cached files when possible.

## Bundled Artifacts

Runtime model assets live in `model_artifacts/`:

- `Weekly/Seq2seqconvlstm`
- `Monthly/DEconvlstm`
- `Seasonal/DEconvlstm`
- `grid/model_grid.npz`

All files under `model_artifacts/` are tracked with Git LFS.

`grid/model_grid.npz` is the extracted grid needed at runtime. The original raw files are not required for normal app use:

- `yearly/clmforc.nldas.YYYY.nc`
- `ELM_EVAPOTRANSPIRATION_2000_2019.nc`
- `ELM_SM_2000-2019.nc`

If `model_artifacts/grid/model_grid.npz` is missing, the app can still reconstruct the grid from those raw NetCDF files when `NLDAS_BASE_DIR`, `NLDAS_FORCING_DIR`, `ELM_ET_PATH`, and `ELM_SM_PATH` point to valid local data.

## Configuration

The defaults should work after cloning with Git LFS and logging into Earthdata. These environment variables are available for custom deployments:

- `DROUGHTAPP_GPU_DEVICE`: optional explicit system GPU ID, for example `0`. When set, it takes precedence over `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: used when `DROUGHTAPP_GPU_DEVICE` is unset. If it contains multiple IDs, the app uses the first one.
- `STREAMLIT_MODEL_ARTIFACTS_DIR`: alternate model artifact directory
- `MODEL_GRID_PATH`: alternate precomputed grid `.npz`
- `NLDAS_CACHE_DIR`: local cache for Earthdata downloads
- `NLDAS_BASE_DIR`, `NLDAS_FORCING_DIR`, `ELM_ET_PATH`, `ELM_SM_PATH`: fallback raw-data paths for rebuilding the model grid

Example:

```bash
export DROUGHTAPP_GPU_DEVICE=0
export NLDAS_CACHE_DIR="$PWD/droughtapp_cache"
streamlit run app.py
```

## Troubleshooting

- If model loading fails, run `git lfs pull` and confirm the files in `model_artifacts/` are not tiny pointer files.
- If Earthdata download fails, re-run `python -c "import earthaccess; earthaccess.login(persist=True)"`.
- If inference fails with a GPU configuration error, first confirm you are inside a GPU session. `python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"` must print at least one GPU before starting Streamlit.
- If the GPU probe works but the app still fails, set `DROUGHTAPP_GPU_DEVICE` to the GPU assigned to your session and restart the app so TensorFlow reads the setting before import.
- If Streamlit starts but the browser cannot connect on a remote server, use `./run.sh` or pass `--server.address 0.0.0.0`.
